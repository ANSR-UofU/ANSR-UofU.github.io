    I am a professor in the School of Computing at the University of Utah.
    Before joining the University of Utah, I spent four exciting years in the
    Mobile Networking Research Department at Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies.
    Earlier, I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Advanced Networks
    Research Group at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.

    I direct the research of the Sensing and Processing Across Networks (SPAN) lab. Our lab specializes in statistical signal processing applied to wireless networks. In particular, we study radio channel signal processing, that is, when the radio network is a sensor itself. We investigate how a network may use radio measurements to monitor itself, to locate the nodes in the network, to learn about physical environment in which it is deployed, to improve network security, and to improve the network deployment process. Research in the SPAN lab applies results from estimation and detection theory, radio propagation, and distributed signal processing.
