  abstract: >
    We design and build a system we call mobiLivUp, that utilizes nearby
    smartphones to improve live wide-area video upstreaming. In mobiLivUp, to
    distribute the video to nearby devices, the video streaming device creates
    a small wireless network using Wi-Fi Direct. Other devices then connect to
    this network. Parts of the video stream are sent to these connected
    devices, which then upload their parts to a location in the wide-area
    network using their cellular connections. We develop algorithms and
    methods to effectively distribute video data to nearby nodes and for
    incentivizing cooperation from these nodes. We test our system through
    trace-driven simulation and implementation in various settings. Our
    experiments show that, in general, mobiLivUp increases the aggregate video
    throughput, depending on the number of nodes forwarding data and their
    data rates.

    Device-free localization (DFL) systems locate a person in an environment by
    measuring the changes in received signals on links in a wireless network. A
    fingerprint-based DFL method collects a training database of measurement
    fingerprints and uses a machine learning classifier to determine a personâ€™s
    location from a new fingerprint. However, as the environment changes over
    time due to furniture or other objects being moved, the fingerprints diverge
    from those in the database. This paper addresses, for DFL methods that use
    received signal strength as measurements, the degradation caused as a result
    of environmental changes. We perform experiments to quantify how changes in
    an environment affect accuracy, through a repetitive process of randomly
    moving an item in a residential home and then conducting a localization
    experiment, and then repeating. We quantify the degradation and consider
    ways to be more robust to environmental change. We find that the
    localization error rate doubles, on average, for every six random changes in
    the environment. We find that the random forests classifier has the lowest
    error rate among four tested. We present a correlation method for selecting
    channels, which decreases the localization error rate from 4.8% to 1.6%.

  abstract: >
    We propose a novel malware detection application - SocialScan - which
    enables friend-to-friend (f2f) malware scanning services among social
    peers, with scanning resource sharing governed by levels of social
    altruism. We show that with f2f sharing of resources, SocialScan achieves a
    65% increase in the detection rate of 0- to 1-day- old malware among
    social peers as compared to the the detection rates of individual
    scanners. We also show that SocialScan provides greatly enhanced malware
    protection to social hubs.

  abstract: >
    We investigate the ability of an attacker to passively use an otherwise
    secure wireless network to detect moving people through walls. We call
    this attack on privacy of people a "monitoring radio windows" (MRW)
    attack. We design and implement the MRW attack methodology to reliably detect
    when a person crosses the link lines between the legitimate transmitters and
    the attack receivers, by using physical layer measurements. We also
    develop a method to estimate the direction of movement of a person from
    the sequence of link lines crossed during a short time interval. Additionally,
    we describe how an attacker may estimate any artificial changes in transmit
    power (used as a countermeasure), compensate for these power changes using
    measurements from sufficient number of links, and still detect line
    crossings. We implement our methodology on WiFi and ZigBee nodes and
    experimentally evaluate the MRW attack by passively monitoring human movements
    through external walls in two real-world settings. We find that %our
    methods an attacker may achieve close to 100% accuracy in detecting line
    crossings and determining direction of motion, even through reinforced
    concrete walls.

    The popularity of smartphones and smartphone applications means that data
    is the dominant traffic type in current mobile networks. In this paper we
    present our work on a systematic investigation into facets of the LTE/EPC
    architecture that impact the performance of TCP as the predominant
    transport layer protocol used by applications on mobile networks. We found
    that (1) load increase in a cell causes dramatic bandwidth reduction on
    UEs and significantly degrades TCP performance, (2) seamless handover
    causes significant TCP losses while lossless handover increases TCP
    segments' delay.

  abstract: >
    Bluetooth has found widespread adoption in phones, wireless headsets,
    stethoscopes, glucose monitors, and oximeters for communication of, at
    times, very critical information. However, the link keys and encryption
    keys in Bluetooth are ultimately generated from a short 4 digit PIN, which
    can be cracked off-line. We develop an alternative for secure
    communication between Bluetooth devices using the symmetric wireless
    channel characteristics. Existing approaches to secret key extraction
    primarily use measurements from a fixed, single channel (e.g., a 20 MHz
    WiFi channel); however in the presence of heavy WiFi traffic, the packet
    exchange rate in such approaches can reduce as much as 200 x. We build and
    evaluate a new method, which is robust to heavy WiFi traffic, using a very
    wide bandwidth (B >> 20 MHz) in conjunction with random frequency hopping.
    We implement our secret key extraction on two Google Nexus One smartphones
    and conduct numerous experiments in indoor-hallway and outdoor settings.
    Using extensive real-world measurements, we show that outdoor settings are
    best suited for secret key extraction using Bluetooth. We also show that
    even in the absence of heavy WiFi traffic, the performance of secret key
    generation using Bluetooth is comparable to that of WiFi while using much
    lower transmit power.

  abstract: >
    In this paper, our goal is to develop approaches to reduce the energy
    consumption in Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI)-based methods for device
    free localization without giving up localization accuracy. Our key idea is
    to only measure those links that are near the current location of the
    moving object being tracked. We propose two approaches to find the most
    effective links near the tracked object. In our first approach, we only
    consider links that are in an ellipse around the current velocity vector
    of the moving object. In our second approach, we only consider links that
    cross through a circle with radius r from the current position of the
    moving object. Thus, rather than creating an attenuation image of the
    whole area in RTI, we only create the attenuation image for effective
    links in a small area close to the current location of the moving object.
    We also develop an adaptive algorithm for determining r. We evaluate the
    proposed approaches in terms of energy consumption and localization error
    in three different test areas. Our experimental results show that using
    our approach, we are able to save 50% to 80% of energy. Interestingly, we
    find that our radius-based approach actually increases the accuracy of
    localization.
