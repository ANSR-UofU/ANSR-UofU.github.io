    Growing demand for data and increasing number of devices are drastically
    changing the scale of operation in mobile networks. Future services and
    business models require efficient provisioning with enhanced traffic
    management. It is hard to meet these requirements on today’s mobile
    networks that are deployed over specialized hardware. While operators are
    keen to adopt NFV (Network Function Virtualization) to virtualize their
    networks, virtualized mobile network deployments face a few technical
    barriers. To address these challenges, we design SCOPE that effectively
    applies concepts from SDN and distributed systems to realize NFV-based LTE
    core networks. Using centralized allocation, SCOPE effectively manages the
    resources across multiple telecom data-centers in a way to meet the
    traffic requirements. To enforce the computed allocations, SCOPE includes
    flexible and efficient mechanisms to configure the data-plane. With full
    compliance to 3GPP- based protocols, SCOPE ensures faster and cost-
    effective deployments. The efficacy of SCOPE is shown using a prototype
    implementation and large-scale simulations.

    Radio network information is leaked well beyond the perimeter in which the
    radio network is deployed. We investigate attacks where person location can
    be inferred using the radio characteristics of wireless links (e.g., the
    received signal strength). An attacker can deploy a network of receivers
    which measure the received signal strength of the radio signals transmitted
    by the legitimate wireless devices inside a perimeter, allowing the attacker
    to learn the locations of people moving in the vicinity of the devices
    inside the perimeter. In this paper, we develop the first solution to this
    location privacy problem where neither the attacker nodes nor the tracked
    moving object transmit any RF signals. We first model the radio network
    leakage attack using a Stackelberg game. Next, we define utility and cost
    functions related to the defender and attacker actions. Last, using our
    utility and cost functions, we find the optimal strategy for the defender by
    applying a greedy method. We evaluate our game theoretic framework using
    experiments and find that our approach significantly reduces the chance of
    an attacker determining the location of people inside a perimeter.

  abstract: >
    We propose a game theoretic framework for task allocation in mobile cloud
    computing that corresponds to offloading of compute tasks to a group of
    nearby mobile devices. Specifically, in our framework, a distributor node
    holds a multidimensional auction for allocating the tasks of a job among
    nearby mobile nodes based on their computational capabilities and also the
    cost of computation at these nodes, with the goal of reducing the overall
    job completion time. Our proposed auction also has the desired incentive
    compatibility property that ensures that mobile devices truthfully reveal
    their capabilities and costs and that those devices benefit from the task
    allocation. To deal with node mobility, we perform multiple auctions over
    adaptive time intervals. We develop a heuristic approach to dynamically find
    the best time intervals between auctions to minimize unnecessary auctions
    and the accompanying overheads. We evaluate our framework and methods using
    both real world and synthetic mobility traces. Our evaluation results show
    that our game theoretic framework improves the job completion time by a
    factor of 2-5 in comparison to the time taken for executing the job locally,
    while minimizing the number of auctions and the accompanying overheads. Our
    approach is also profitable for the nearby nodes that execute the
    distributor's tasks with these nodes receiving a compensation higher than
    their actual costs.

    We design and build a system we call mobiLivUp, that utilizes nearby
    smartphones to improve live wide-area video upstreaming. In mobiLivUp, to
    distribute the video to nearby devices, the video streaming device creates
    a small wireless network using Wi-Fi Direct. Other devices then connect to
    this network. Parts of the video stream are sent to these connected
    devices, which then upload their parts to a location in the wide-area
    network using their cellular connections. We develop algorithms and
    methods to effectively distribute video data to nearby nodes and for
    incentivizing cooperation from these nodes. We test our system through
    trace-driven simulation and implementation in various settings. Our
    experiments show that, in general, mobiLivUp increases the aggregate video
    throughput, depending on the number of nodes forwarding data and their
    data rates.

    In addition to growth of data traffic, mobile networks are bracing for a
    significant rise in the control-plane signaling. While a complete re-design
    of the network to overcome inefficiencies may help alleviate the effects of
    signaling, our goal is to improve the design of the current platform to
    better manage the signaling. To meet our goal, we combine two key trends.
    Firstly, mobile operators are keen to transform their networks with the
    adoption of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to ensure economies of
    scales. Secondly, growing popularity of cloud computing has led to advances
    in distributed systems. In bringing these trends together, we solve several
    challenges specific to the context of telecom networks. We present SCALE - A
    framework for effectively virtualizing the MME (Mobility Management Entity),
    a key control-plane element in LTE. SCALE is fully compatible with the 3GPP
    protocols, ensuring that it can be readily deployed in today's networks.
    SCALE enables (i) computational scaling with load and number of devices, and
    (ii) computational multiplexing across data centers, thereby reducing both,
    the latencies for control-plane processing, and the VM provisioning costs.
    Using an LTE prototype implementation and large-scale simulations, we show
    the efficacy of SCALE.

  abstract: >
    Device-free localization (DFL) systems locate a person in an environment by
    measuring the changes in received signals on links in a wireless network. A
    fingerprint-based DFL method collects a training database of measurement
    fingerprints and uses a machine learning classifier to determine a person’s
    location from a new fingerprint. However, as the environment changes over
    time due to furniture or other objects being moved, the fingerprints diverge
    from those in the database. This paper addresses, for DFL methods that use
    received signal strength as measurements, the degradation caused as a result
    of environmental changes. We perform experiments to quantify how changes in
    an environment affect accuracy, through a repetitive process of randomly
    moving an item in a residential home and then conducting a localization
    experiment, and then repeating. We quantify the degradation and consider
    ways to be more robust to environmental change. We find that the
    localization error rate doubles, on average, for every six random changes in
    the environment. We find that the random forests classifier has the lowest
    error rate among four tested. We present a correlation method for selecting
    channels, which decreases the localization error rate from 4.8% to 1.6%.

    Our evaluation shows that our adaptive approach enables the network to

    We investigate the ability of an attacker to passively use an otherwise

    this attack on privacy of people a "monitoring radio windows" (MRW)
    attack. We design and implement the MRW attack methodology to reliably detect
    when a person crosses the link lines between the legitimate transmitters and
    the attack receivers, by using physical layer measurements. We also
    develop a method to estimate the direction of movement of a person from
    the sequence of link lines crossed during a short time interval. Additionally,
    we describe how an attacker may estimate any artificial changes in transmit
    power (used as a countermeasure), compensate for these power changes using
    measurements from sufficient number of links, and still detect line
    crossings. We implement our methodology on WiFi and ZigBee nodes and
    experimentally evaluate the MRW attack by passively monitoring human movements
    through external walls in two real-world settings. We find that %our
    methods an attacker may achieve close to 100% accuracy in detecting line

    Bluetooth has found widespread adoption in phones, wireless headsets,
    stethoscopes, glucose monitors, and oximeters for communication of, at
    times, very critical information. However, the link keys and encryption
    keys in Bluetooth are ultimately generated from a short 4 digit PIN, which
    can be cracked off-line. We develop an alternative for secure
    communication between Bluetooth devices using the symmetric wireless
    channel characteristics. Existing approaches to secret key extraction
    primarily use measurements from a fixed, single channel (e.g., a 20 MHz
    WiFi channel); however in the presence of heavy WiFi traffic, the packet
    exchange rate in such approaches can reduce as much as 200 x. We build and
    evaluate a new method, which is robust to heavy WiFi traffic, using a very
    wide bandwidth (B >> 20 MHz) in conjunction with random frequency hopping.
    We implement our secret key extraction on two Google Nexus One smartphones
    and conduct numerous experiments in indoor-hallway and outdoor settings.
    Using extensive real-world measurements, we show that outdoor settings are
    best suited for secret key extraction using Bluetooth. We also show that
    even in the absence of heavy WiFi traffic, the performance of secret key
    generation using Bluetooth is comparable to that of WiFi while using much
    lower transmit power.

  abstract: >
    In this paper, our goal is to develop approaches to reduce the energy
    consumption in Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI)-based methods for device
    free localization without giving up localization accuracy. Our key idea is
    to only measure those links that are near the current location of the
    moving object being tracked. We propose two approaches to find the most
    effective links near the tracked object. In our first approach, we only
    consider links that are in an ellipse around the current velocity vector
    of the moving object. In our second approach, we only consider links that
    cross through a circle with radius r from the current position of the
    moving object. Thus, rather than creating an attenuation image of the
    whole area in RTI, we only create the attenuation image for effective
    links in a small area close to the current location of the moving object.
    We also develop an adaptive algorithm for determining r. We evaluate the
    proposed approaches in terms of energy consumption and localization error
    in three different test areas. Our experimental results show that using
    our approach, we are able to save 50% to 80% of energy. Interestingly, we
    find that our radius-based approach actually increases the accuracy of
    localization.

  abstract: >
    Secret key establishment is a fundamental requirement for private
    communication between two entities. In this article, we propose and evaluate
    a new approach for secret key extraction where multiple sensors collaborate
    in exchanging probe packets and collecting channel measurements.
    Essentially, measurements from multiple channels have a substantially higher
    differential entropy compared to the measurements from a single channel,
    thereby resulting in more randomness in the information source for key
    extraction, and this in turn produces stronger secret keys. We also explore
    the fundamental trade-off between the quadratic increase in the number of
    measurements of the channels due to multiple nodes per group versus a linear
    reduction in the sampling rate and a linear increase in the time gap between
    bidirectional measurements. To experimentally evaluate collaborative secret
    key extraction in wireless sensor networks, we first build a simple yet
    flexible testbed with multiple TelosB sensor nodes. Next, we perform large-
    scale experiments with different configurations of collaboration. Our
    experiments show that in comparison to the 1 × 1 configuration,
    collaboration among sensor nodes significantly increases the secret bit
    extraction per second, per probe, as well as per millijoule of transmission
    energy. In addition, we show that the collaborating nodes can improve the
    performance further when they exploit both space and frequency diversities.

    This paper shows experimentally that standard wireless networks which

    breathing and estimate the breathing rate, an application we call
    "BreathTaking". We show that although an individual link cannot reliably
    detect breathing, the collective spectral content of a network of devices
    reliably indicates the presence and rate of breathing. We present a maximum
    likelihood estimator (MLE) of breathing rate, amplitude, and phase, which
    uses the RSS data from many links simultaneously. We show experimental
    results which demonstrate that reliable detection and frequency estimation
    is possible with 30 seconds of data, within 0.3 breaths per minute (bpm) RMS
    error. Use of directional antennas is shown to improve robustness to motion
    near the network.

  abstract: >
    Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), widely recommended for
    sharing the spectrum among different nodes in a dynamic spectrum access
    network, imposes tight timing and frequency synchronization requirements. We
    examine the use of filterbank multicarrier (FBMC), a somewhat lesser known
    and understood alternative, for dynamic spectrum access. FBMC promises very
    low out-of-band energy of each subcarrier signal when compared to OFDM. In
    order to fully understand and evaluate the promise of FBMC, we first examine
    the use of special pulse-shaping filters of the FBMC PHY layer in reliably
    transmitting data packets at a very high rate. Next, to understand the
    impact of FBMC beyond the PHY layer, we devise a distributed and adaptive
    medium access control (MAC) protocol that coordinates data packet traffic
    among the different nodes in the network in a best-effort manner. Using
    extensive simulations, we show that FBMC consistently achieves at least an
    order of magnitude performance improvement over OFDM in several aspects
    including packet transmission delays, channel access delays, and effective
    data transmission rate available to each node in static, indoor settings.
    Using measurements of power spectral density and high data rate
    transmissions from a transceiver that we build using our National
    Instruments hardware platform, we show that while FBMC can
    decode/distinguish all the received symbols without any errors, OFDM cannot.
    Finally, we also examine the use of FBMC in a vehicular network setup. We
    find that FBMC achieves an order of magnitude performance improvement over
    large distances in this setup as well. Furthermore, in the case of multihop
    vehicular networks, FBMC can achieve about 20 × smaller end-to-end data
    packet delivery delays and relatively low packet drop probabilities. In
    summary, FBMC offers a much higher performing alternative to OFDM for
    networks that dynamically share the spectrum among multiple nodes.

    We evaluate the effectiveness of secret key extraction, for private
    communication between two wireless devices, from the received signal
    strength (RSS) variations on the wireless channel between the two devices.
    We use real world measurements of RSS in a variety of environments and
    settings. The results from our experiments with 802.11-based laptops show
    that in certain environments, due to lack of variations in the wireless
    channel, the extracted bits have very low entropy making these bits
    unsuitable for a secret key, an adversary can cause predictable key
    generation in these static environments, and in dynamic scenarios where the
    two devices are mobile, and/or where there is a significant movement in the
    environment, high entropy bits are obtained fairly quickly. Building on the
    strengths of existing secret key extraction approaches, we develop an
    environment adaptive secret key generation scheme that uses an adaptive
    lossy quantizer in conjunction with Cascade-based information reconciliation
    and privacy amplification. Our measurements show that our scheme, in
    comparison to the existing ones that we evaluate, performs the best in terms
    of generating high entropy bits at a high bit rate. The secret key bit
    streams generated by our scheme also pass the randomness tests of the NIST
    test suite that we conduct. We also build and evaluate the performance of
    secret key extraction using small, low-power, hand-held devices-Google Nexus
    One phones-that are equipped 802.11 wireless network cards. Last, we
    evaluate secret key extraction in a multiple input multiple output
    (MIMO)-like sensor network testbed that we create using multiple TelosB
    sensor nodes. We find that our MIMO-like sensor environment produces
    prohibitively high bit mismatch, which we address using an iterative
    distillation stage that we add to the key extraction process. Ultimately, we
    show that the secret key generation rate is increased when multiple sensors
    are involved in the key extraction process.

  abstract: >
    Radio frequency (RF) sensor networks are wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    which use only the received signal strength (RSS) to perform tasks such as
    device-free localization (DFL) and tracking of individuals. In these
    systems, people to be located do not participate in the localization effort
    by carrying any radio device or sensor. Instead, a static deployed wireless
    network measures RSS on its links and locates people based on the variations
    caused by the movements of people in the monitored area. In this paper, we
    present features and functioning of an RF sensor network deployed in a home
    for indoor localization and tracking for ambient assisted living (AAL). Our
    system is composed of low-power IEEE 802.15.4 transceivers, operating in the

    Variance-based Radio Tomographic Imaging (VRTI) is an emerging technology
    that locates moving objects in areas surrounded by simple and inexpensive
    wireless sensor nodes. VRTI uses human motion induced variation in RSS and
    spatial correlation between link variations to locate and track people. An
    artificially induced power variations in the deployed network by an
    adversary can introduce unprecedented errors in localization process of VRTI
    and, given the critical applications of VRTI, can potentially lead to
    serious consequences including loss of human lives. In this paper, we tackle
    the problem of detecting malicious receivers that report false RSS values to
    induce artificial power variations in a VRTI system. We use the term
    “Receiver Attack” to refer to such malicious power changes. We use a
    combination of statistical hypothesis testing and heuristics to develop
    real-time methods to detect receiver attack in a VRTI system. Our results
    show that we can detect receiver attacks of reasonable intensity and
    identify the source(s) of malicious activity with very high accuracy.

  abstract: >
    Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), widely recommended for
    sharing the spectrum among different nodes in a dynamic spectrum access
    network, imposes tight timing and frequency synchronization requirements. We
    examine the use of filterbank multicarrier (FBMC), a somewhat lesser known
    and understood alternative, for dynamic spectrum access. FBMC promises very
    low out-of-band energy of each subcarrier signal when compared to OFDM. In
    order to fully understand and evaluate the promise of FBMC, we first examine
    the use of special pulse shaping filters of the FBMC PHY layer in reliably
    transmitting data packets at a very high rate. Next, to understand the
    impact of FBMC beyond the PHY layer, we devise a distributed and adaptive
    medium access control (MAC) protocol that coordinates data packet traffic
    among the different nodes in the network in a best effort manner. Using
    extensive simulations, we show that FBMC consistently achieves at least an
    order of magnitude performance improvement over OFDM in several aspects
    including packet transmission delays, channel access delays, and effective
    data transmission rate available to each node. Using measurements of power
    spectral density and high data rate transmissions from a transceiver that we
    build using our National Instruments hardware platform, we show that while
    FBMC can decode/distinguish all the received symbols without any errors,
    OFDM cannot. In summary, FBMC offers a much higher performing alternative to
    OFDM for networks that dynamically share the spectrum among multiple nodes.

    Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), widely recommended for

    understanding of the cross-layer performance of FBMC, as well as to
    understand its impact beyond the PHY layer, we build a discrete event
    simulator using realistic models. Using extensive simulations, we show
    that FBMC consistently achieves an order of magnitude performance
    improvement over OFDM in terms of packet transmission delays and effective
    data transmission rate available to each node, over large distances in
    comparison to OFDM. Finally, our analysis in the case of multi-hop
    networks shows that FBMC can achieve about 20x smaller end-to-end data
    packet delivery delays, and relatively low packet drop probabilities in
    comparison to OFDM. In summary, our results can serve as guidelines for

    Emergency "911" service is a critical function provided in the PSTN,

    capable devices, enabling them to send emergency messages through any
    available hotspot or access point. Our service makes use of existing
    802.11 management frames and does not require the client device to
    associate or authenticate with the access point; this makes it available
    even on protected networks to which the client would not normally have
    access, even encrypted ones. This design ensures maximum potential reach

    Measurements of received signal strength (RSS) on wireless links provide
    position information in various localization systems, including
    multilateration-based and fingerprint-based positioning systems, and
    device-free localization systems. Existing localization schemes assume a
    fixed or known transmit power. Therefore, any variation in transmit power
    can result in error in location estimate. In this paper, we present a
    generic framework for detecting power attacks and identifying the source
    of such transmit power variation. Our results show that we can achieve
    close to zero missed detections and false alarms with RSS measurements of
    only 50 transmissions. We also present an analysis of trade-off between
    accuracy and latency of detection for our method.

  abstract: >
    Perimeter distinction in a wireless network is the ability to distinguish
    locations belonging to different perimeters. It is complementary to
    existing localization techniques. A draw-back of the localization method
    is that when a transmitter is at the edge of an area, an algorithm with
    isotropic error will estimate its location in the wrong area at least half
    of the time. In contrast, perimeter distinction classifies the location as
    being in one area or the adjacent regardless of the transmitter position
    within the area. In this paper, we use the naturally different wireless
    fading conditions to accurately distinguish locations across perimeters.
    We examine the use of two types of wireless measurements: received signal
    strength (RSS) and wireless link signature (WLS), and propose multiple
    methods to retain good distinction rates even when the receiver faces
    power manipulation by malicious transmitters. Using extensive measurements
    of indoor and outdoor perimeters, we find that WLS outperforms RSS in
    various fading conditions. Even without using signal power WLS can achieve
    accurate perimeter distinction up to 80%. When we train our perimeter
    distinction method with multiple measurements within the same perimeter,
    we show that we are able to improve the accuracy of perimeter distinction,
    up to 98%.

  abstract: >
    We investigate location distinction, the ability of a receiver to determine
    when a transmitter has changed location, which has application for energy
    conservation in wireless sensor networks, for physical security of radio-
    tagged objects, and for wireless network security in detection of
    replication attacks. In this paper, we investigate using a measured temporal
    link signature to uniquely identify the link between a transmitter (TX) and
    a receiver (RX). When the TX changes location, or if an attacker at a
    different location assumes the identity of the TX, the proposed location
    distinction algorithm reliably detects the change in the physical channel.
    This detection can be performed at a single RX or collaboratively by
    multiple receivers. We use 9,000 link signatures recorded at different
    locations and over time to demonstrate that our method significantly
    increases the detection rate and reduces the false alarm rate, in comparison
    to existing methods. We present a procedure to estimate the mutual
    information in link and link signature using the Edgeworth approximation.
    For the measured data set, we show that approximately 66 bits of link
    information is contained in each measured link signature.

    social peers to approximate levels of altruism and to collaborate on flash

    swarms of mixed social and non-social peers. We implement SocialSwarm as
    an extension to the Rasterbar libtorrent library—widely used by BitTorrent
    clients—and evaluate it on a testbed of 500 independent clients with
    social distances extracted from Facebook. We show that SocialSwarm can

    In this paper, we shed light on the cross-layer interactions between the
    PHY, link and routing layers in networks with MIMO links operating in the
    diversity mode. Many previous studies assume an overly simplistic PHY
    layer model that does not sufficiently capture these interactions. We show
    that the use of simplistic models can in fact lead to misleading
    conclusions with regards to the higher layer performance with MIMO
    diversity. Towards understanding the impact of various PHY layer features
    on MIMO diversity, we begin with a simple but widely-used model and
    progressively incorporate these features to create new models. We examine
    the goodness of these models by comparing the simulated performance
    results with each, with measurements on an indoor 802.11n testbed. Our
    work reveals several interesting cross-layer dependencies that affect the
    gains due to MIMO diversity. In particular, we observe that relative to
    SISO links: (a) PHY layer gains due to MIMO diversity do not always carry
    over to the higher layers, (b) the use of other PHY layer features such as
    FEC codes significantly influence the gains due to MIMO diversity, and (c)
    the choice of the routing metric can impact the gains possible with MIMO.

    We propose an approach where wireless devices, interested in establishing
    a secret key, sample the channel impulse response (CIR) space in a
    physical area to collect and combine uncorrelated CIR measurements to
    generate the secret key. We study the impact of mobility patterns in
    obtaining uncorrelated measurements. Using extensive measurements in both
    indoor and outdoor settings, we find that (i) when movement step size is
    larger than one foot the measured CIRs are mostly uncorrelated, and (ii)
    more diffusion in the mobility results in less correlation in the measured
    CIRs. We develop efficient mechanisms to encode CIRs and reconcile the
    differences in the bits extracted between the two devices. Our results
    show that our scheme generates very high entropy secret bits and that too
    at a high bit rate. The secret bits, that we generate using our approach,
    also pass the 8 randomness tests of the NIST test suite.

    We explore the use of clock skew of a wireless local area network access
    point (AP) as its fingerprint to detect unauthorized APs quickly and
    accurately. The main goal behind using clock skews is to overcome one of the
    major limitations of existing solutions - the inability to effectively
    detect Medium Access Control (MAC) address spoofing. We calculate the clock
    skew of an AP from the IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function (TSF) time
    stamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. We use two different
    methods for this purpose - one based on linear programming and the other
    based on least-square fit. We supplement these methods with a heuristic for
    differentiating original packets from those sent by the fake APs. We collect
    TSF time stamp data from several APs in three different residential
    settings. Using our measurement data as well as data obtained from a large
    conference setting, we find that clock skews remain consistent over time for
    the same AP but vary significantly across APs. Furthermore, we improve the
    resolution of received time stamp of the frames and show that with this
    enhancement, our methodology can find clock skews very quickly, using 50-100
    packets in most of the cases. We also discuss and quantify the impact of
    various external factors including temperature variation, virtualization,
    clock source selection, and NTP synchronization on clock skews. Our results
    indicate that the use of clock skews appears to be an efficient and robust
    method for detecting fake APs in wireless local area networks.

  abstract: >
    Secret keys can be generated and shared between two wireless nodes by
    measuring and encoding radio channel characteristics without ever revealing
    the secret key to an eavesdropper at a third location. This paper addresses
    bit extraction, i.e., the extraction of secret key bits from noisy radio
    channel measurements at two nodes such that the two secret keys reliably
    agree. Problems include 1) nonsimultaneous directional measurements, 2)
    correlated bit streams, and 3) low bit rate of secret key generation. This
    paper introduces high-rate uncorrelated bit extraction (HRUBE), a framework
    for interpolating, transforming for decorrelation, and encoding channel
    measurements using a multibit adaptive quantization scheme which allows
    multiple bits per component. We present an analysis of the probability of
    bit disagreement in generated secret keys, and we use experimental data to
    demonstrate the HRUBE scheme and to quantify its experimental performance.
    As two examples, the implemented HRUBE system can achieve 22 bits per second
    at a bit disagreement rate of 2.2 percent, or 10 bits per second at a bit
    disagreement rate of 0.54 percent.

    that uses the phenomenon of physical capture at the physical layer for
    effectively distinguishing losses due to collisions from those due to
    channel-error. We first estimate the number of packets dropped due to
    collisions, at each node by counting the number of packets that are not
    successfully retrieved by physical capture. Next, using a simple
    algorithm, we assign this collision loss to neighboring sources of packets
    that might have generated the colliding packets. Using extensive ns- 2
    simulations, we show that our multirate adaptation scheme consistently
    outperforms the existing schemes.

    We evaluate the effectiveness of secret key extraction, for private
    communication between two wireless devices, from the received signal
    strength (RSS) variations on the wireless channel between the two devices.
    We use real world measurements of RSS in a variety of environments and
    settings. Our experimental results show that (i) in certain environments,
    due to lack of variations in the wireless channel, the extracted bits have
    very low entropy making these bits unsuitable for a secret key, (ii) an
    adversary can cause predictable key generation in these static
    environments, and (iii) in dynamic scenarios where the two devices are
    mobile, and/or where there is a significant movement in the environment,
    high entropy bits are obtained fairly quickly. Building on the strengths
    of existing secret key extraction approaches, we develop an environment
    adaptive secret key generation scheme that uses an adaptive lossy
    quantizer in conjunction with Cascade-based information reconciliation and
    privacy amplification. Our measurements show that our scheme, in
    comparison to the existing ones that we evaluate, performs the best in
    terms of generating high entropy bits at a high bit rate. The secret key
    bit streams generated by our scheme also pass the randomness tests of the
    NIST test suite that we conduct.

    measurements in wireless networking systems for location distinction. We
    first compare two existing location distinction methods - one based on
    channel gains of multi-tonal probes, and another on channel impulse
    response. Next, we combine the benefits of these two methods to develop a
    new link measurement that we call the complex temporal signature. We use a
    2.4 GHz link measurement data set, obtained from CRAWDAD [10], to evaluate
    the three location distinction methods. We find that the complex temporal
    signature method performs significantly better compared to the existing
    methods. We also perform new measurements to understand and model the
    temporal behavior of link signatures over time. We integrate our model in
    our location distinction mechanism and significantly reduce the
    probability of false alarms due to temporal variations of link signatures.

    We design a framework that implements security at the TCP layer to meet
    the necessity for a practical and truly end-to-end security solution. We
    call our framework TCPsec. TCPsec is a security extension to TCP and
    implemented in the kernel. Applications may use TCPsec through regular TCP
    sockets by setting special socket options. TCPsec uses a Secure Socket
    Layer (SSL)-like handshake to set up a secure session. It is interoperable
    with Network Address Translators. We implement TCPsec in the FreeBSD 4.7
    kernel and evaluate its performance. Our implementation and evaluation
    show that TCPsec incurs only a modest overhead as compared to TCP and
    performs competitively with SSL. We also provide a formal verification of
    our protocol state machine.

    We present a new distributed approach that establishes reputation-based
    trust among sensor nodes in order to identify malfunctioning and malicious
    sensor nodes and minimize their impact on applications. Our method adapts
    well to the special characteristics of wireless sensor networks, the most
    important being their resource limitations. Our methodology computes
    statistical trust and a confidence interval around the trust based on
    direct and indirect experiences of sensor node behavior. By considering
    the trust confidence interval, we are able to study the tradeoff between
    the tightness of the trust confidence interval with the resources used in
    collecting experiences. Furthermore, our approach allows dynamic scaling
    of redundancy levels based on the trust relationship between the nodes of
    a wireless sensor network. Using extensive simulations we demonstrate the
    benefits of our approach over an approach that uses static redundancy
    levels in terms of reduced energy consumption and longer life of the
    network. We also find that high confidence trust can be computed on each
    node with a relatively small memory overhead and used to determine the
    level of redundancy operations among nodes in the system.

    Congestion caused by a large number of interacting TCP flows at a
    bottleneck network link is different from that caused by a lesser number
    of flows sending large amounts of data -the former would require cutting
    down the number of competing flows, while cutting down the data sending
    rate is sufficient for the latter. However, since existing congestion
    control schemes view congestion only from a packet-level perspective, they
    treat both to be the same, resulting in suboptimal performance. We propose
    two best effort, search-based, session (or flow) level congestion control
    strategies for the Internet, to complement existing packet-level
    congestion control schemes. Our strategies control the number of competing
    flows to optimize for the flow completion rate and the flow completion
    time. Furthermore, our session control mechanisms do not require any per-
    flow state or computation at the routers, make no assumption about input
    traffic characteristics and requirements, avoid starvation of new flows
    when existing flows do not leave the system, and do not require any end
    host TCP modifications. Using evaluations under a wide variety of static
    and varying traffic load conditions, we demonstrate the significant
    performance and fairness gains that our session control mechanisms
    provide.

    The ability of a receiver to determine when a transmitter has changed
    location is important for energy conservation in wireless sensor networks,
    for physical security of radio-tagged objects, and for wireless network
    security in detection of replication attacks. In this paper, we propose
    using a measured temporal link signature to uniquely identify the link
    between a transmitter and a receiver. When the transmitter changes
    location, or if an attacker at a different location assumes the identity
    of the transmitter, the proposed link distinction algorithm reliably
    detects the change in the physical channel. This detection can be
    performed at a single receiver or collaboratively by multiple receivers.
    We record over 9,000 link signatures at different locations and over time
    to demonstrate that our method significantly increases the detection rate
    and reduces the false alarm rate, in comparison to existing methods.

    To aid security in the Internet, we propose a new connection oriented
    architecture to restrict reachability in the Internet to only those end
    hosts that explicitly request it. We first describe the various components
    of our architecture. Next, using qualitative arguments, and some
    preliminary computations, we show the benefits of our architecture. We
    also present viable strategies for minimizing connection state at routers,
    and discuss relevant security issues.

  abstract: >
    Networked systems are often evaluated on overlay testbeds such as
    PlanetLab and emulation testbeds such as Emulab. Emulation testbeds give
    users great control over the host and network environments and offer easy
    reproducibility, but only artificial network conditions. Overlay testbeds
    provide real network conditions, but are not repeatable environments and
    provide less control over the experiment.

    We describe the motivation, design, and implementation of Flexlab, a new
    testbed with the strengths of both overlay and emulation testbeds. It
    enhances an emulation testbed by providing the ability to integrate a wide
    variety of network models, including those obtained from an overlay
    network. We present three models that demonstrate its usefulness,
    including "application-centric Internet modeling" that we specifically
    developed for Flexlab. Its key idea is to run the application within the
    emulation testbed and use its offered load to measure the overlay network.
    These measurements are used to shape the emulated network. Results
    indicate that for evaluation of applications running over Internet paths,
    Flexlab with this model can yield far more realistic results than either
    PlanetLab without resource reservations, or Emulab without topological
    information.

    The authors propose to secure ad hoc networks against data injection
    attacks by placing firewall functionality at strategic locations in the ad
    hoc network. The authors first show that, given the locations of attackers
    and victims, the problem of placement of firewall functionality at a fixed
    number of ad hoc nodes while minimizing the impact of the data injection
    attack is identical to the k-coverage problem, this problem is known to be
    NP-hard. Then, the authors develop a near-optimal approximate algorithm
    for placing firewall functions. The authors also incorporate the loss
    behavior of wireless links in our algorithm. Next, the authors develop an
    architecture to determine the location of the attackers. Our architecture
    uses a separate control network (a cellular network in this paper) in
    conjunction with ad hoc networks to provide a provable attack detection
    mechanism. The authors evaluate our firewall placement algorithm for
    various topologies obtained from ns-2 simulations. Our results show that
    our algorithm can find near-optimal solutions. Based on a simple analysis
    and measurement results, the authors also find that the overhead of our
    provable attack detection mechanism is low.

    Research prototypes of networked systems are often evaluated on overlay
    testbeds and emulation testbeds. Most of the strengths and weaknesses of
    these two types of testbeds are complementary. We outline the motivation,
    design, implementation, and sample results of an environment that seeks to
    provides the best of each type. Flexlab couples an emulation testbed with
    arbitrary network models. We also present a novel modeling technique tuned
    for this environment, application-centric Internet modeling. The key idea
    is to monitor the application’s offered network load within the emulation
    testbed, replicate that load on the overlay testbed, measure the path’s
    characteristics through analysis of the traffic, and use those to shape
    the emulated network.

  abstract: >
    We propose multi-class signaling overload control algorithms, for
    telecommunication switches, that are robust against different input
    traffic patterns and system upgrades. In order to appropriately measure
    the system load when several classes of signaling traffic are present, we
    first introduce the concept of equivalent system load measure that
    converts the multiple system measures associated with different classes of
    traffic into a single measure with respect to a pre-defined base class. We
    use this measure to develop three multi-class overload detection and
    measurement algorithms. Next, we develop a new algorithm for partitioning
    the allowable equivalent system load across multiple traffic classes,
    using a strict priority scheme. Using simulations of call flows from
    mobile telecommunications standards, we compare different multi-class
    overload algorithms under a variety of overload conditions. Our simulation
    results indicate that our algorithm that measures system load using a
    combination of request acceptance rate and processor occupancy provides
    highly reactive and robust overload control. Last, for the purpose of
    making the overload control algorithms more robust, we propose a
    measurement-based simple regression technique to dynamically estimate key
    system parameters. We find that estimates derived in this manner converge
    rapidly to their true values.

  abstract: >
    We identify two typical problems in WLAN hotspots that result in unbounded
    unfairness between upstream and downstream flows. The first unfairness
    problem arises due to the uniformity of the MAC layer protocol at the
    access point (AP) and user nodes that result in equal share to the AP and
    the user nodes but not to the individual flows. The second unfairness
    problem arises due to the inability of the physical layer to distinguish
    frame errors due to hidden terminal based collisions and frame errors due
    to poor signal strength. We present FairMAC, a deployable solution that
    addresses these unfairness problems without requiring a change to the
    802.11 protocol. Thus, our solution is immediately deployable in the
    millions of currently operational hotspots. We evaluate the performance of
    our protocol using simulations and a prototype implementation. We show
    that FairMAC provides fair access to all the flows regardless whether they
    are originating at the AP or a host.

    Expected Data Rate: An Accurate High Throughput Path Metric for Multi-hop

  abstract: >
    We present a new metric, Expected Data Rate (EDR), for accurately finding
    high-throughput paths in multi-hop ad hoc wireless networks. Our metric is
    based upon a new model for transmission interference which is a critical
    factor in determining path throughput. We construct a realistic and
    practical transmission interference model by (1) determining transmission
    contention degree of each link as a function of the wireless link loss,
    (2) quantifying the impact of the wireless link loss on medium access
    backoff, and (3) considering possible concurrent transmissions when two
    links do not interfere with each other. Our transmission interference
    model also takes the non-optimality of IEEE 802.11 medium access
    scheduling into account. Using extensive ns-2 simulations of IEEE 802.11
    ad hoc networks, we find that EDR can accurately determine the achievable
    data rates of ad hoc paths, thereby significantly outperforming the other
    existing metrics.

  abstract: >
    Although multicast communication is well-suited to shared wireless links,
    receiver heterogeneity impedes the use of multicast in wireless networks.
    In this paper, we examine an approach that addresses the receiver
    heterogeneity problem in cellular multicast with the help of an additional
    IEEE 802.11 ad hoc network. The basic idea is to allow the cellular
    receivers experiencing poor channel conditions to use the ad hoc network
    to connect to those cellular receivers that are experiencing good cellular
    channel conditions. The good receivers (called proxies) relay multicast
    data to the poor receivers through the ad hoc network. We specifically
    consider the third generation cellular high data rate (HDR)
    broadcast/multicast services (BCMCS). We develop a new routing algorithm
    to find efficient ad hoc paths from the proxies to the cellular multicast
    receivers. Unlike existing algorithms (Luo et al. (2003)), our routing
    algorithm considers the effect of ad hoc path interference. Using
    simulations of an HDR BCMCS network in conjunction with an IEEE ad hoc
    network, we show that our algorithm improves the receiver goodput by up to
    280% compared to that obtained without using ad hoc paths. We also show
    that our algorithm achieves up to 98% higher receiver goodput in
    comparison to the greedy algorithm proposed in Luo.
