    We design and build a system we call mobiLivUp, that utilizes nearby
    smartphones to improve live wide-area video upstreaming. In mobiLivUp, to
    distribute the video to nearby devices, the video streaming device creates
    a small wireless network using Wi-Fi Direct. Other devices then connect to
    this network. Parts of the video stream are sent to these connected
    devices, which then upload their parts to a location in the wide-area
    network using their cellular connections. We develop algorithms and
    methods to effectively distribute video data to nearby nodes and for
    incentivizing cooperation from these nodes. We test our system through
    trace-driven simulation and implementation in various settings. Our
    experiments show that, in general, mobiLivUp increases the aggregate video
    throughput, depending on the number of nodes forwarding data and their
    data rates.

    Device-free localization (DFL) systems locate a person in an environment by
    measuring the changes in received signals on links in a wireless network. A
    fingerprint-based DFL method collects a training database of measurement
    fingerprints and uses a machine learning classifier to determine a person’s
    location from a new fingerprint. However, as the environment changes over
    time due to furniture or other objects being moved, the fingerprints diverge
    from those in the database. This paper addresses, for DFL methods that use
    received signal strength as measurements, the degradation caused as a result
    of environmental changes. We perform experiments to quantify how changes in
    an environment affect accuracy, through a repetitive process of randomly
    moving an item in a residential home and then conducting a localization
    experiment, and then repeating. We quantify the degradation and consider
    ways to be more robust to environmental change. We find that the
    localization error rate doubles, on average, for every six random changes in
    the environment. We find that the random forests classifier has the lowest
    error rate among four tested. We present a correlation method for selecting
    channels, which decreases the localization error rate from 4.8% to 1.6%.

    65% increase in the detection rate of 0- to 1-day- old malware among
    social peers as compared to the the detection rates of individual

    We investigate the ability of an attacker to passively use an otherwise
    secure wireless network to detect moving people through walls. We call
    this attack on privacy of people a "monitoring radio windows" (MRW)
    attack. We design and implement the MRW attack methodology to reliably detect
    when a person crosses the link lines between the legitimate transmitters and
    the attack receivers, by using physical layer measurements. We also
    develop a method to estimate the direction of movement of a person from
    the sequence of link lines crossed during a short time interval. Additionally,
    we describe how an attacker may estimate any artificial changes in transmit
    power (used as a countermeasure), compensate for these power changes using
    measurements from sufficient number of links, and still detect line
    crossings. We implement our methodology on WiFi and ZigBee nodes and
    experimentally evaluate the MRW attack by passively monitoring human movements
    through external walls in two real-world settings. We find that %our
    methods an attacker may achieve close to 100% accuracy in detecting line
    crossings and determining direction of motion, even through reinforced
    concrete walls.

  abstract: >
    Bluetooth has found widespread adoption in phones, wireless headsets,
    stethoscopes, glucose monitors, and oximeters for communication of, at
    times, very critical information. However, the link keys and encryption
    keys in Bluetooth are ultimately generated from a short 4 digit PIN, which
    can be cracked off-line. We develop an alternative for secure
    communication between Bluetooth devices using the symmetric wireless
    channel characteristics. Existing approaches to secret key extraction
    primarily use measurements from a fixed, single channel (e.g., a 20 MHz
    WiFi channel); however in the presence of heavy WiFi traffic, the packet
    exchange rate in such approaches can reduce as much as 200 x. We build and
    evaluate a new method, which is robust to heavy WiFi traffic, using a very
    wide bandwidth (B >> 20 MHz) in conjunction with random frequency hopping.
    We implement our secret key extraction on two Google Nexus One smartphones
    and conduct numerous experiments in indoor-hallway and outdoor settings.
    Using extensive real-world measurements, we show that outdoor settings are
    best suited for secret key extraction using Bluetooth. We also show that
    even in the absence of heavy WiFi traffic, the performance of secret key
    generation using Bluetooth is comparable to that of WiFi while using much
    lower transmit power.

  abstract: >
    In this paper, our goal is to develop approaches to reduce the energy
    consumption in Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI)-based methods for device
    free localization without giving up localization accuracy. Our key idea is
    to only measure those links that are near the current location of the
    moving object being tracked. We propose two approaches to find the most
    effective links near the tracked object. In our first approach, we only
    consider links that are in an ellipse around the current velocity vector
    of the moving object. In our second approach, we only consider links that
    cross through a circle with radius r from the current position of the
    moving object. Thus, rather than creating an attenuation image of the
    whole area in RTI, we only create the attenuation image for effective
    links in a small area close to the current location of the moving object.
    We also develop an adaptive algorithm for determining r. We evaluate the
    proposed approaches in terms of energy consumption and localization error
    in three different test areas. Our experimental results show that using
    our approach, we are able to save 50% to 80% of energy. Interestingly, we
    find that our radius-based approach actually increases the accuracy of
    localization.

  abstract: >
    Secret key establishment is a fundamental requirement for private
    communication between two entities. In this article, we propose and evaluate
    a new approach for secret key extraction where multiple sensors collaborate
    in exchanging probe packets and collecting channel measurements.
    Essentially, measurements from multiple channels have a substantially higher
    differential entropy compared to the measurements from a single channel,
    thereby resulting in more randomness in the information source for key
    extraction, and this in turn produces stronger secret keys. We also explore
    the fundamental trade-off between the quadratic increase in the number of
    measurements of the channels due to multiple nodes per group versus a linear
    reduction in the sampling rate and a linear increase in the time gap between
    bidirectional measurements. To experimentally evaluate collaborative secret
    key extraction in wireless sensor networks, we first build a simple yet
    flexible testbed with multiple TelosB sensor nodes. Next, we perform large-
    scale experiments with different configurations of collaboration. Our
    experiments show that in comparison to the 1 × 1 configuration,
    collaboration among sensor nodes significantly increases the secret bit
    extraction per second, per probe, as well as per millijoule of transmission
    energy. In addition, we show that the collaborating nodes can improve the
    performance further when they exploit both space and frequency diversities.

  abstract: >
    This paper shows experimentally that standard wireless networks which
    measure received signal strength (RSS) can be used to reliably detect human
    breathing and estimate the breathing rate, an application we call
    "BreathTaking". We show that although an individual link cannot reliably
    detect breathing, the collective spectral content of a network of devices
    reliably indicates the presence and rate of breathing. We present a maximum
    likelihood estimator (MLE) of breathing rate, amplitude, and phase, which
    uses the RSS data from many links simultaneously. We show experimental
    results which demonstrate that reliable detection and frequency estimation
    is possible with 30 seconds of data, within 0.3 breaths per minute (bpm) RMS
    error. Use of directional antennas is shown to improve robustness to motion
    near the network.

  abstract: >
    Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), widely recommended for
    sharing the spectrum among different nodes in a dynamic spectrum access
    network, imposes tight timing and frequency synchronization requirements. We
    examine the use of filterbank multicarrier (FBMC), a somewhat lesser known
    and understood alternative, for dynamic spectrum access. FBMC promises very
    low out-of-band energy of each subcarrier signal when compared to OFDM. In
    order to fully understand and evaluate the promise of FBMC, we first examine
    the use of special pulse-shaping filters of the FBMC PHY layer in reliably
    transmitting data packets at a very high rate. Next, to understand the
    impact of FBMC beyond the PHY layer, we devise a distributed and adaptive
    medium access control (MAC) protocol that coordinates data packet traffic
    among the different nodes in the network in a best-effort manner. Using
    extensive simulations, we show that FBMC consistently achieves at least an
    order of magnitude performance improvement over OFDM in several aspects
    including packet transmission delays, channel access delays, and effective
    data transmission rate available to each node in static, indoor settings.
    Using measurements of power spectral density and high data rate
    transmissions from a transceiver that we build using our National
    Instruments hardware platform, we show that while FBMC can
    decode/distinguish all the received symbols without any errors, OFDM cannot.
    Finally, we also examine the use of FBMC in a vehicular network setup. We
    find that FBMC achieves an order of magnitude performance improvement over
    large distances in this setup as well. Furthermore, in the case of multihop
    vehicular networks, FBMC can achieve about 20 × smaller end-to-end data
    packet delivery delays and relatively low packet drop probabilities. In
    summary, FBMC offers a much higher performing alternative to OFDM for
    networks that dynamically share the spectrum among multiple nodes.

  abstract: >
    We evaluate the effectiveness of secret key extraction, for private
    communication between two wireless devices, from the received signal
    strength (RSS) variations on the wireless channel between the two devices.
    We use real world measurements of RSS in a variety of environments and
    settings. The results from our experiments with 802.11-based laptops show
    that in certain environments, due to lack of variations in the wireless
    channel, the extracted bits have very low entropy making these bits
    unsuitable for a secret key, an adversary can cause predictable key
    generation in these static environments, and in dynamic scenarios where the
    two devices are mobile, and/or where there is a significant movement in the
    environment, high entropy bits are obtained fairly quickly. Building on the
    strengths of existing secret key extraction approaches, we develop an
    environment adaptive secret key generation scheme that uses an adaptive
    lossy quantizer in conjunction with Cascade-based information reconciliation
    and privacy amplification. Our measurements show that our scheme, in
    comparison to the existing ones that we evaluate, performs the best in terms
    of generating high entropy bits at a high bit rate. The secret key bit
    streams generated by our scheme also pass the randomness tests of the NIST
    test suite that we conduct. We also build and evaluate the performance of
    secret key extraction using small, low-power, hand-held devices-Google Nexus
    One phones-that are equipped 802.11 wireless network cards. Last, we
    evaluate secret key extraction in a multiple input multiple output
    (MIMO)-like sensor network testbed that we create using multiple TelosB
    sensor nodes. We find that our MIMO-like sensor environment produces
    prohibitively high bit mismatch, which we address using an iterative
    distillation stage that we add to the key extraction process. Ultimately, we
    show that the secret key generation rate is increased when multiple sensors
    are involved in the key extraction process.

    New techniques in cross-layer wireless networks are building demand for

    measurement system with little additional computational complexity compared
    to 802.11b reception alone. The system implementation, using the universal
    software radio peripheral (USRP) and GNU Radio, is described and compared to
    previous work. We validate the CIR measurement system and present the
    results of a measurement campaign which measures millions of CIRs between
    WiFi access points and a mobile receiver in urban and suburban areas.

  abstract: >
    We investigate location distinction, the ability of a receiver to determine
    when a transmitter has changed location, which has application for energy
    conservation in wireless sensor networks, for physical security of radio-
    tagged objects, and for wireless network security in detection of
    replication attacks. In this paper, we investigate using a measured temporal
    link signature to uniquely identify the link between a transmitter (TX) and
    a receiver (RX). When the TX changes location, or if an attacker at a
    different location assumes the identity of the TX, the proposed location
    distinction algorithm reliably detects the change in the physical channel.
    This detection can be performed at a single RX or collaboratively by
    multiple receivers. We use 9,000 link signatures recorded at different
    locations and over time to demonstrate that our method significantly
    increases the detection rate and reduces the false alarm rate, in comparison
    to existing methods. We present a procedure to estimate the mutual
    information in link and link signature using the Edgeworth approximation.
    For the measured data set, we show that approximately 66 bits of link
    information is contained in each measured link signature.

  abstract: >
    We explore the use of clock skew of a wireless local area network access
    point (AP) as its fingerprint to detect unauthorized APs quickly and
    accurately. The main goal behind using clock skews is to overcome one of the
    major limitations of existing solutions - the inability to effectively
    detect Medium Access Control (MAC) address spoofing. We calculate the clock
    skew of an AP from the IEEE 802.11 Time Synchronization Function (TSF) time
    stamps sent out in the beacon/probe response frames. We use two different
    methods for this purpose - one based on linear programming and the other
    based on least-square fit. We supplement these methods with a heuristic for
    differentiating original packets from those sent by the fake APs. We collect
    TSF time stamp data from several APs in three different residential
    settings. Using our measurement data as well as data obtained from a large
    conference setting, we find that clock skews remain consistent over time for
    the same AP but vary significantly across APs. Furthermore, we improve the
    resolution of received time stamp of the frames and show that with this
    enhancement, our methodology can find clock skews very quickly, using 50-100
    packets in most of the cases. We also discuss and quantify the impact of
    various external factors including temperature variation, virtualization,
    clock source selection, and NTP synchronization on clock skews. Our results
    indicate that the use of clock skews appears to be an efficient and robust
    method for detecting fake APs in wireless local area networks.

  abstract: >
    Secret keys can be generated and shared between two wireless nodes by
    measuring and encoding radio channel characteristics without ever revealing
    the secret key to an eavesdropper at a third location. This paper addresses
    bit extraction, i.e., the extraction of secret key bits from noisy radio
    channel measurements at two nodes such that the two secret keys reliably
    agree. Problems include 1) nonsimultaneous directional measurements, 2)
    correlated bit streams, and 3) low bit rate of secret key generation. This
    paper introduces high-rate uncorrelated bit extraction (HRUBE), a framework
    for interpolating, transforming for decorrelation, and encoding channel
    measurements using a multibit adaptive quantization scheme which allows
    multiple bits per component. We present an analysis of the probability of
    bit disagreement in generated secret keys, and we use experimental data to
    demonstrate the HRUBE scheme and to quantify its experimental performance.
    As two examples, the implemented HRUBE system can achieve 22 bits per second
    at a bit disagreement rate of 2.2 percent, or 10 bits per second at a bit
    disagreement rate of 0.54 percent.

    Radio network information is leaked well beyond the perimeter in which the
    radio network is deployed. We investigate attacks where person location can
    be inferred using the radio characteristics of wireless links (e.g., the
    received signal strength). An attacker can deploy a network of receivers
    which measure the received signal strength of the radio signals transmitted
    by the legitimate wireless devices inside a perimeter, allowing the attacker
    to learn the locations of people moving in the vicinity of the devices
    inside the perimeter. In this paper, we develop the first solution to this
    location privacy problem where neither the attacker nodes nor the tracked
    moving object transmit any RF signals. We first model the radio network
    leakage attack using a Stackelberg game. Next, we define utility and cost
    functions related to the defender and attacker actions. Last, using our
    utility and cost functions, we find the optimal strategy for the defender by
    applying a greedy method. We evaluate our game theoretic framework using
    experiments and find that our approach significantly reduces the chance of
    an attacker determining the location of people inside a perimeter.

  abstract: >
    We propose a game theoretic framework for task allocation in mobile cloud
    computing that corresponds to offloading of compute tasks to a group of
    nearby mobile devices. Specifically, in our framework, a distributor node
    holds a multidimensional auction for allocating the tasks of a job among
    nearby mobile nodes based on their computational capabilities and also the
    cost of computation at these nodes, with the goal of reducing the overall
    job completion time. Our proposed auction also has the desired incentive
    compatibility property that ensures that mobile devices truthfully reveal
    their capabilities and costs and that those devices benefit from the task
    allocation. To deal with node mobility, we perform multiple auctions over
    adaptive time intervals. We develop a heuristic approach to dynamically find
    the best time intervals between auctions to minimize unnecessary auctions
    and the accompanying overheads. We evaluate our framework and methods using
    both real world and synthetic mobility traces. Our evaluation results show
    that our game theoretic framework improves the job completion time by a
    factor of 2-5 in comparison to the time taken for executing the job locally,
    while minimizing the number of auctions and the accompanying overheads. Our
    approach is also profitable for the nearby nodes that execute the
    distributor's tasks with these nodes receiving a compensation higher than
    their actual costs.

    In addition to growth of data traffic, mobile networks are bracing for a

    adoption of Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to ensure economies of
    scales. Secondly, growing popularity of cloud computing has led to advances
    in distributed systems. In bringing these trends together, we solve several
    challenges specific to the context of telecom networks. We present SCALE - A
    framework for effectively virtualizing the MME (Mobility Management Entity),
    a key control-plane element in LTE. SCALE is fully compatible with the 3GPP
    protocols, ensuring that it can be readily deployed in today's networks.
    SCALE enables (i) computational scaling with load and number of devices, and
    (ii) computational multiplexing across data centers, thereby reducing both,
    the latencies for control-plane processing, and the VM provisioning costs.
    Using an LTE prototype implementation and large-scale simulations, we show
    the efficacy of SCALE.

    When traffic arrives from the network for an idled mobile device, the
    network executes device activation procedures to wake the device up. Current
    device activation mechanisms are ill suited to support the expected growth
    of machine-to-machine (M2M) devices and traffic. We propose an adaptive
    device activation architecture for LTE/EPC cellular networks that adapts to
    network conditions and M2M application requirements to realize scalable
    device activation without increasing the resources used for this purpose.
    Our evaluation shows that our adaptive approach enables the network to
    handle M2M applications with a large number of devices without negatively
    impacting existing human-to-human (H2H) and human-to-machine (H2M) traffic.

    Configuration errors are the most significant cause of failure in networks.
    Little research has been devoted to preventing network configuration errors
    using device fingerprints. We demonstrate how they can be used to prevent
    information from being incorrectly routed in an IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled
    wireless sensor network with multiple coordinators. To determine if they are
    appropriate for this application, we investigate the number of unique
    fingerprints that clock skew and radio frequency characteristics provide.

  abstract: >
    Radio frequency (RF) sensor networks are wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    which use only the received signal strength (RSS) to perform tasks such as
    device-free localization (DFL) and tracking of individuals. In these
    systems, people to be located do not participate in the localization effort
    by carrying any radio device or sensor. Instead, a static deployed wireless
    network measures RSS on its links and locates people based on the variations
    caused by the movements of people in the monitored area. In this paper, we
    present features and functioning of an RF sensor network deployed in a home
    for indoor localization and tracking for ambient assisted living (AAL). Our
    system is composed of low-power IEEE 802.15.4 transceivers, operating in the
    2.4 GHz ISM band, that collect and process RSS data in real-time and
    estimate the locations of people over time.

  abstract: >
    Variance-based Radio Tomographic Imaging (VRTI) is an emerging technology
    that locates moving objects in areas surrounded by simple and inexpensive
    wireless sensor nodes. VRTI uses human motion induced variation in RSS and
    spatial correlation between link variations to locate and track people. An
    artificially induced power variations in the deployed network by an
    adversary can introduce unprecedented errors in localization process of VRTI
    and, given the critical applications of VRTI, can potentially lead to
    serious consequences including loss of human lives. In this paper, we tackle
    the problem of detecting malicious receivers that report false RSS values to
    induce artificial power variations in a VRTI system. We use the term
    “Receiver Attack” to refer to such malicious power changes. We use a
    combination of statistical hypothesis testing and heuristics to develop
    real-time methods to detect receiver attack in a VRTI system. Our results
    show that we can detect receiver attacks of reasonable intensity and
    identify the source(s) of malicious activity with very high accuracy.

  abstract: >
    Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), widely recommended for
    sharing the spectrum among different nodes in a dynamic spectrum access
    network, imposes tight timing and frequency synchronization requirements. We
    examine the use of filterbank multicarrier (FBMC), a somewhat lesser known
    and understood alternative, for dynamic spectrum access. FBMC promises very
    low out-of-band energy of each subcarrier signal when compared to OFDM. In
    order to fully understand and evaluate the promise of FBMC, we first examine
    the use of special pulse shaping filters of the FBMC PHY layer in reliably
    transmitting data packets at a very high rate. Next, to understand the
    impact of FBMC beyond the PHY layer, we devise a distributed and adaptive
    medium access control (MAC) protocol that coordinates data packet traffic
    among the different nodes in the network in a best effort manner. Using
    extensive simulations, we show that FBMC consistently achieves at least an
    order of magnitude performance improvement over OFDM in several aspects
    including packet transmission delays, channel access delays, and effective
    data transmission rate available to each node. Using measurements of power
    spectral density and high data rate transmissions from a transceiver that we
    build using our National Instruments hardware platform, we show that while
    FBMC can decode/distinguish all the received symbols without any errors,
    OFDM cannot. In summary, FBMC offers a much higher performing alternative to
    OFDM for networks that dynamically share the spectrum among multiple nodes.
