    I am interested in researching mobile networks, mobile computing, and
    wireless network management. I am passionate about building real systems
    that enhance and extend wireless networks and have experience building
    various systems both at the application layer and cross-layer. These
    include developing a system for live streaming video using multiple
    cellular devices, building ad hoc network primitives on Android devices
    for content-based networking, WiFi association protocol changes, and
    localization in sensor networks. I am knowledgeable in many different
    programming languages and frameworks and have developed numerous wireless
    applications on the Android platform.
